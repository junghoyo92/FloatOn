Welcome to Float On!

The objective of the game is to dodge all obstacles that come your way.
Jump when necessary, duck when necessary, just STAY ALIVE.

To dodge the obstacles on the bottom, jump by pressing the UP arrow key.
To dodge the obstacles on the top, duck by pressing the DOWN arrow key.

The ball automatically resets to the middle after a dodge, 
so make sure you get the timing of the next dodge JUST right.

If at any point in the game, you feel extremely overwhelmed, do not fret.
Hit the SPACE BAR and you can pause the game.
Hit it again and jump back in.

Ready, set, GO!
